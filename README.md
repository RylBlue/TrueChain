Blockchain smart contracts from scratch

After playing around with ethereum smart contracts, I started to wonder how difficult it would be to actually create a blockchain smart contract system myself.

Currently, I have a rough assembly instruction framework and a hash-map based database system.

The ony thing left to do until this would be a rough "blockchain" system would be to have assembly code storage on the databse and some simplistic databse function calls.

(You would also need some block storage system as well obviously)

I will not be supporting this too heavily, also all assembly instructions are subject to change without notice.

Take this as inspiration for what can be done, not how to do it.
